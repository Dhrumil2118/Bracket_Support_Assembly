# Bracket_Support_Assembly
Bracket Support Assembly modeled in SolidWorks with renders and animation
🧱 Bracket Support Assembly – SolidWorks Project
This GitHub repository contains a Bracket Support Assembly designed and assembled using SolidWorks.
It includes all 3D part models, the final assembly, rendered images, and an exploded view animation.

📌 Note: 2D technical drawings are not included in this version.

📁 Project Structure
Parts/ – All .SLDPRT part files (bracket arms, base plate, fasteners, gussets)

Assembly/ – .SLDASM assembly file

Renders/ – Rendered images of the complete model and exploded view

Animation/ – MP4 animation showing exploded view or movement

🛠 Components Modeled
Vertical and Horizontal Brackets

Base Support Plate

Gusset or Reinforcement Plates

Bolts and Fasteners (if applicable)

⚙️ Assembly Notes
Proper mates used for alignment and structural constraints

Simulated bracket-to-base and fastener placement

Functional, real-world orientation maintained

🎥 Animation
Created using SolidWorks Motion Study, the animation illustrates:
